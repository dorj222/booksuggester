# BookSuggester
## Description

BookSuggester is a React app designed to provide users with random book recommendations sourced from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), a vast online library of free eBooks. Users can explore a wide range of literary works and discover new titles across various genres and subjects, with a focus on older works for which U.S. copyright has expired.

With BookSuggester, users can personalize their reading experience by creating their own bookshelf. They can save suggested books to their bookshelf, allowing for easy access to their favorite titles. Additionally, users can view detailed information about each suggested book, including its genre and subject, helping them make informed decisions about their reading choices.

On the Discovery page, users can open settings to configure different literature periods, such as Enlightenment or Modernism. Additionally, they can choose topics such as Fiction, History, or Philosophy, enhancing their ability to discover books tailored to their interests.

On the Bookshelf page, readers can rate the books by 5 stars, use the search bar for easy navigation, and sort books by recently added, ratings, or alphabetical order. This empowers users to manage their reading lists effectively and track their reading progress with greater flexibility.

BookSuggester offers a seamless and user-friendly interface for book enthusiasts to discover, save, and manage their reading materials effortlessly. Whether users are looking for literary classics or contemporary gems, BookSuggester provides a convenient platform for exploring the world of literature.
